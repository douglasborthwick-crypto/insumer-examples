///
/// @dev Architecture
///      ----------------------------------------------------------------
///      The proof is the attestation's Wallet Auth token: the ES256 JWT
///      InsumerAPI returns from `POST /v1/attest` with `"format": "jwt"`.
///      `hasAccess` takes the compact token bytes as `data`, verifies the
///      signature on-chain, and reads every claim it acts on from the
///      signed payload itself (see `InsumerAttestationToken`):
///        sub            the wallet the condition evaluated (== account)
///        pass           the issuer's verdict (must be true)
///        conditionHash  the evaluated condition (must be the pinned one)
///        exp            expiry (must be later than block.timestamp)
///      Nothing is taken from the caller beside the token, so the caller
///      cannot pair a genuine signature with claims the issuer did not make.
///
/// @dev Deploying
///      ----------------------------------------------------------------
///      Deploy only on a chain that provides the `P256VERIFY` precompile at
///      `0x0100`; without it every token is denied.
///
///      One deployment gates one condition, and a token carries exactly one
///      condition hash. The ERC-8257 reference `CompositePredicate` cannot
///      combine several of these predicates: it forwards the same `data` to
///      every term and gives each term 50,000 gas, below what one token
///      check costs.
///
///      Pin a condition on an EVM chain. A token's `sub` names the wallet
///      the condition evaluated, and `account` is an EVM address, so a
///      condition on a non-EVM chain can never be satisfied here.
///
///      Pin the `conditionHash` your own API key returns. A v1 key and a
///      v2 key can hash the same condition differently (a `token_balance`
///      condition does, an `nft_ownership` condition does not), so a
///      deployment serves the key era whose hash it pins. The hash covers
///      the condition exactly as written, including the letter case of a
///      contract address, so an agent must send the same condition object
///      to obtain a token that matches. Conditions that include the wallet
///      itself (`erc8004_agent`, `erc7710_delegation`) hash to a value that
///      gates exactly one wallet.
///
///      The pinned hash cannot be reversed into the condition. Publish the
///      exact condition object, as it must be sent to `/v1/attest`, in the
///      tool's ERC-8257 manifest so agents know what to request.
///
/// @dev What the token proves
///      ----------------------------------------------------------------
///      The token is a signed public statement about a wallet's state, not
///      a secret: it carries no audience, and anyone holding it can present
///      it until `exp` (30 minutes after issuance, 5 when the request
///      includes an `erc7710_delegation` condition). It proves the state of
///      `account`, not that the caller controls `account`. ERC-8257
///      §"Account Parameter Is Advisory" applies: downstream enforcers MUST
///      bind `account` to the real principal independently, for example
///      with the requester-signed AccessProof pattern. The same verdict can
///      be encoded as more than one valid token string (ECDSA signatures
///      admit a high-s twin), so a consumer tracking replay keys on the
///      token's `jti` claim (read from the payload off-chain), not on its
///      bytes.
///
/// @dev Why this shape rather than direct on-chain reads
///      ----------------------------------------------------------------
///      Predicates that read holdings on-chain (ERC-721, ERC-1155,
///      subscription) see only the chain the registry is deployed on. An
///      issuer-signed verdict lets a registry on one chain gate on wallet
///      state held on another, evaluated off-chain and verified here.
///
/// @dev Gas budget
///      ----------------------------------------------------------------
///      About 130,000 gas for a typical single-condition token, and under
///      200,000 up to the 64 KB token limit, including for malformed input.
///      The reference registry calls `hasAccess` with 200,000 gas.
///
/// @dev GETTING CREDENTIALS
///      ----------------------------------------------------------------
///      Free tier, no credit card: 100 daily reads + 10 attestation credits.
